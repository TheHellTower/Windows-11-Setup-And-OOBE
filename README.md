# Windows-11-Setup-And-OOBE

## ðŸ“œ Why this repository ?

Microsoft may remove some options in future setup updates so I'm saving interesting stuff it could be useful if they just remove commands since most of the time regedit values still work.

## List

- `OOBE\BYPASSNRO` run [bypassnro.bat](https://github.com/TheHellTower/Windows-11-Backup/blob/main/bypassnro.bat) and it allows to bypass the need of internet while doing the setup.
